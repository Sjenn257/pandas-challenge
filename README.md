# Pandas Challenge

In this challenge, I have analyzed data for a recent fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli, for an independent gaming company.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 

# Insights:

- The game appears to attract more males, making up 84% of players
- 45% of customers are in their early twenties (20-24) followed by 19% in their late teens (15-19 years)
- On average, customers purchase 4 optional items
- Although males generate the most purchase value, on average they spend $0.40-0.50 less than females and other/non-disclosed genders
- On average, adults between the ages of 35-39, children less than 10 years, and adults between the ages of 20-24 spend more per purchase
- Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm are the most popular items purchased

# Stats:
